        of the prominent private engineering colleges in

        Sri Swamy Vivekananda Educational Trust, which manages
        several schools, polytechnics, and colleges in the 
        region.The origin of the institution goes back to
        educational efforts by the Trust, which started 
        with a small Nursery and Primary School in 1984. 
        Over the years, the institution expanded and added 
        higher educational institutions, eventually establishing 
        the engineering college.</h3>
